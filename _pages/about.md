Hi! I am Hai Nguyen. 

<p style='text-align: justify'> 
I came from Bac Ninh in Vietnam. In 2014, I graduated from Hanoi University of Science and Technology (<a href="https://en.hust.edu.vn/" target="_blank">HUST</a>) majoring in Electronics and Telecommunications. I had spent 5 years working in several industrial fields (Embedded System Software, Factory Automation, Database) in both Vietnam and Japan. In 2019, I decided to pursue my graduate study at Ritsumeikan University. In 2021, I got my Master's Degree from Ritsumeikan majoring in <a href="http://en.ritsumei.ac.jp/gsise/" target="_blank" >Advance Information and Science Engineering</a>.</p>

<p style='text-align: justify'> 
Currently, I am working as a python developer in the Research Department of (<a href="https://www.ics-p.net/" target="_blank"><strong>ICS Partners</strong></a>), which is located in Kyoto Research Park (<a href="http://www.krp.co.jp/" target="_blank"><strong>KRP</strong></a>).
My role is to apply machine learning & NLP algorithms to develop Computer Vision Web APIs for building Robotic Process Automation (RPA) products.</p>

<p style='text-align: justify'> 
My research interests cover the following topics Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing, Data Science and OpenCV-OCR.</p>
