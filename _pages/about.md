Hi! I am Hai Nguyen. 
I came from Bac Ninh in VietNam. In 2014, I graduated from Hanoi University of Science and Technology (HUST) majoring in Electronics and Telecommunications. I had spent 5 years working in several industrial fields (Embedded System Software, Factory Automation, IT Support) in both Viet Nam and Japan. In 2019, I decided to pursue my graduate study at Ritsumeikan University. In 2021, I got my Master's Degree from Ritsumeikan majoring in Advance Information and Science Engineering.
Currently, I am working as a python developer in the Research Department of **[ICS Partners](https://www.ics-p.net/)**, which is located in Kyoto Research Park (**[KRP](http://www.krp.co.jp/)**) 
My role is to apply machine learning & NLP algorithms to Computer Vision WEB APIs for building Robotic Process Automation (RPA) products.

My research interests focus on the following topics ML/DL/NLP, Data Science and OpenCV-OCR.

This website [^2] (powered by **[fastpages](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages)**) is the memo of my own self-practices notebooks from Data Science related online courses or books. So it may contain some obsolete contents due to the latest updated time of the notebooks. If you find something, or have a question about contents, just feel free to contact me through [mail](mailto:nguyenngochaibkhn@gmail.com) or comment it in each page (comments are linked to my github with [utteranc.es](https://utteranc.es/))
